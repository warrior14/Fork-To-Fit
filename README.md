## What is Fork To Fit?
The Fork To Fit App is a nutrition app that users can utilize to obtain knowledge about healthy macronutrients and customize a meal plan. The app displays a list of healthy carb, fat and protein sources that the users can select from to add to their meal plan. I built this CRUD app with ASP.NET MVC, SQL Server, Bootstrap and CSS.


I built this app for my Back-End Capstone project for Nashville Software School.
